Java sorted stack 

What the project does?
  Project reads a list of user integer inputs and stores them into a Stack. 
  1.  The user enters a series of integers.
  2.  The integers are first stored in a LinkedList, which is then sorted.
  3.  After sorting, the integers are pushed into a Stack in ascending order (smallest to largest).
  4.  The Java Collections Framework is used to manage the sorting and storing of integer

Why the project is useful ?
  1. project is useful for beginners to get a better understanding on Stack and LinkedList.
  2. Practical use of the Java Collections Framework, specifically for sorting and managing collections.
  3.  A clear demonstration of how to implement a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure using Java.
